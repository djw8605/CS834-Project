\subsection{VHDL Design}
We decided to design our filter using as much HDL as possible.  Therefore, every component is written in VHDL, and are synthesized for the final design. The VHDL is separated into components listed below.  These components are then sythensized using the rc cadenced synthesizer. 

Separate components:
\begin{itemize}
\item D\_FF
\item CONV\_MULT
\item ADD16
\item FullAdder
\end{itemize}
