Low pass filters are used in many applications from noise filtering to RF modulation.  Low pass filters are well understood, and include logically simple components: registers, adders, and multipliers.  In this project, we will design a low power low pass filter using the VHDL and the Cadence hardware designer.  We will include optimizations for power such as reducing components and reducing transitions.

In section \ref{sec:design}, we will discuss our design philosophy and design decisions.  In section \ref{sec:implementation} we will describe how we constructed the components and connected them.  Finally, in section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we will discuss problems we experienced in our design and the tools we used.
