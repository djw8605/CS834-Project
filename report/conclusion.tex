% Conclusion

In this project, we created a power optimized low pass filter.  We avoid using a floating point unit by utilizing the Q15 format.  The filter is symmetric, allowing for optimizations.  The input and output is kept simple.    The power optimizations where done at design time using the algorithmic level.  The components where developed in VHDL.  The design was verified both at the functional level with a C++ program, and using the VHDL through a simulator.  The components where synthesized using the Cadence tools.  Finally, the layout was done using the autorouter in Cadence.
